Foursquare is becoming very popular now days,so its obvious that we need a foursquare widget for elgg.
So i divided the widget development project into two parts.
First is the foursquare_api which exposes the foursquare api functions and allows a great level of administrative flexibility.
This is the second part of the project which includes a foursquare widget for elgg and displays users checkins.

Remember this works only for elgg 1.8.

Needs foursquare_api plugin to be installed.
